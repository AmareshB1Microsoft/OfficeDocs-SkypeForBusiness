# Microsoft Teams new client usage report

The Microsoft Teams desktop client usage report gives you an overview of the Teams desktop clients in use within your organization. It highlights platform, version, and user type to help you better understand the current state of your user’s desktop clients.

## How to get to the Microsoft Teams desktop client usage report

1. In the Teams admin center, go to the **Analytics & Reports** > **Usage Reports** page.
1. From the Usage Reports page, choose the **Teams desktop client usage report**, choose a date range selection, and select **Run report**.

## Interpret the Microsoft Teams device usage report

The graph in the Teams desktop client usage report shows the usage of classic Teams and new Teams as a percentage within your tenant. These numbers are directly related – if one increases the other will decrease. Take note of these important characteristics of this data:

- This data only represents Windows or Mac Teams desktop clients. It does not show any data about other client types, such as web, mobile, or any hardware devices.
- This data is dependent on a user’s Teams desktop client being actively used. If a user is not active on their desktop client or their data is prevented from reporting in for any reason, their data will be empty for that period in which there was no data available. This can result in fluctuations in the data, for example during weekends or when users go on vacation.
- A user’s data originates from their most recent usage when the snapshot is taken. If a user has multiple machines they use regularly, whichever they used last will be represented for that day. For most users that do have multiple machines, they usually have a primary that gets the majority of their usage.
