# Configure call recording, transcription, and captions in Teams

In Microsoft Teams, users can record, transcribe, and view captions in their Teams calls.

Follow the guides and resources [Accessibility guide for Microsoft Teams admins](accessibility-guide-admin.md) to configure Teams for optimal accessibility.

## Allow or prevent users from recording calls

You can use the Microsoft Teams admin center or PowerShell to set a Teams calling policy to control whether users' calls can be recorded.

Many users use calls and meetings interchangeably depending on their needs. We recommend you check your meeting recording policy settings as well. If the settings are different for calls and meetings, it might cause confusion for your users.

# [**Calling policy**](#tab/calling-policy)

To allow or prevent call recordings:

1. In the Microsoft [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/), expand **Voice**.
1. Select **Calling policies**.
1. Select the policy that you want to edit.
1. Turn **Cloud recording for calling** On or Off.
1. Select **Save**.

With PowerShell, you configure the `-AllowCloudRecordingForCalls` parameter in [Set-CsTeamsCallingPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamscallingpolicy).

# [**Meeting policy**](#tab/meeting-policy)

To allow or prevent meeting recordings:

1. In the Microsoft [Teams admin center](https://admin.teams.microsoft.com/), expand **Meetings**.
1. Select **Meeting policies**.
1. Select the policy that you want to edit.
1. Turn **Meeting recording** On or Off.
1. Select **Save**.

With PowerShell, you configure the `-AllowCloudRecording` parameter in [Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmeetingpolicy).

## Enable call transcription

Transcription is auto-generated, recorded text of what was said in a call. When turned on, the transcript is available to users to review after a call has ended. This setting is off by default.

### Using the Teams admin center

To turn on call transcription for users:

1. In the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Voice**, and then select **Calling policies**.

2. Select the policy you want to modify.

3. Turn **Transcription** to **On**, then select **Save**.

### Using PowerShell

With PowerShell, you configure the `-AllowTranscriptionForCalling` parameter in [Set-CsTeamsCallingPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamscallingpolicy).

For example, this script enables transcription for the global policy:

```powershell
Set-CsTeamsCallingPolicy -Identity Global -AllowTranscriptionForCalling $true
```

## Enable call captions

### Using the Teams admin center

Captions are real-time auto-generated text of what is said in a call. They appear a few lines at a time for a user who has turned them on, and arenâ€™t saved.

To turn on real-time captions for calls for users:

1. In the Microsoft Teams admin center, go to **Voice**, and then select **Calling policies**.

2. Select the policy you want to modify.

3. Turn **Real-time captions in Teams calls** to **On**, then select **Save**.

### Using PowerShell

With PowerShell, you configure the `-LiveCaptionsEnabledTypeForCalling` parameter in [Set-CsTeamsCallingPolicy](/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamscallingpolicy).

For example, this script allows the user to turn on real-time captions in the global policy:

```powershell
Set-CsTeamsCallingPolicy -Identity Global -LiveCaptionsEnabledTypeForCalling DisabledUserOverride
```

In this example, the script prevents the user from turning on real-time captions in the global policy:

```powershell
Set-CsTeamsCallingPolicy -Identity Global -LiveCaptionsEnabledTypeForCalling Disabled
```
