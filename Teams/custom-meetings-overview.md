# Teams Premium meetings customization options

[!INCLUDE[Teams Premium ECM](includes/teams-premium-ecm.md)]

Microsoft Teams has a number of options for meeting customization for organizations with Teams Premium licensing. From templates to meeting themes to custom backgrounds, personalizing the meeting experience and making meeting set-up more efficient has never been easier. If you have a Developer License as well as Teams Premium, Teams Custom Together Mode is also something you can explore.

## Custom meeting templates

With meeting templates, you can preset many of the options that are available to meeting organizers, including security, audio and video, recording and transcription, and meeting engagement settings. This feature can save time and ensure consistency across meetings of a similar nature, such as weekly team meetings or client check-ins.

## Meeting themes

Meeting themes allow admins to customize the visual appearance of the pre-join and lobby screens by applying a specific theme. Meeting themes consist of your organization’s brand colors, a custom image to represent your branding, and your organization’s logo.

## Custom meeting backgrounds

Custom meeting backgrounds allow admins to upload custom organizational images to for end-users to use as virtual backgrounds during meetings. This feature can help users maintain privacy, reduce distractions, or add a touch of corporate unity to their meetings. You can use a user or group policy to assign unique corporate backgrounds to specific individuals or departments.

## Custom together mode scenes

Teams together mode uses AI segmentation technology to place meeting participants in a shared virtual space. Teams together mode can help make your meetings feel more natural and engaging, and bringing that sense of togetherness to your organization's meetings. You can create, customize, or accept custom together mode scenes for meetings that are then available to your end users with a Teams Premium license.
