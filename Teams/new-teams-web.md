# New Teams for Web - Overview and prerequisites

The new Teams for Web is reimagined from the ground up with performance in mind, providing a faster, simpler, and more flexible experience. The new Teams client installs and loads faster, letting you launch the app and join meetings more quickly, giving you more time to focus on the business tasks.

## Classic Teams for Web users to be updated to New Teams for Web after March 31, 2024

New Teams for Web is now generally available. New Teams allows us to release new capabilities to market faster. With the move to general availability, new features, capabilities, and enhancements to existing features are available exclusively on new Teams.
After March 31, 2024, any classic Teams for Web users who haven't updated to new Teams will be [automatically updated to new Teams for Web](/microsoftteams/new-teams-automatic-upgrade-announced). 

## How to try new Teams: App Switcher 

1. Navigate to the Teams web client at https://teams.microsoft.com using Microsoft Edge or Chrome browsers.
2. Select the **Try the new Teams** toggle on the upper-left corner of the app to switch to new Teams.


## Prerequisites

### Minimum Browser versions

New Teams for Web follows the same [browser requirements](/microsoftteams/get-clients?tabs=Windows#browser-client) and [hardware requirements](/microsoftteams/hardware-requirements-for-the-teams-app) as classic Teams for Microsoft Edge and Chrome Browsers:

- The browser must be configured to allow third-party cookies
- The browser runs on a desktop computer
- The browser is updated to one of the three most-recent versions of Microsoft Edge or Chrome

The new Teams web client offers near feature parity with the new Desktop client thanks to a new, cross-client infrastructure. 

## Features currently not available

The following notable features aren't available on new Teams or classic Teams clients:

- Simultaneous availability and notifications across multiple accounts and tenants
- Popout windows for chat and channel content
- Avatars and video background effects, except for background blur

## Enhancements in new Teams

The following issues from classic Teams Web are now fixed in new Teams Web:

- Support for more than two concurrent Teams tabs
- Screen reader challenges with notifications
- Various stability and performance issues
