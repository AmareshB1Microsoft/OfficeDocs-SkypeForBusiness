# Overview of standard channels in Microsoft Teams

There are three types of channels in Microsoft Teams that serve different purposes: standard, private, and shared.

In this article, we'll go over what a standard channel is and what it can be used for.

## What is a standard channel?

A **standard channel** is visible to all members of a team and provides a space for members to collaborate and communicate.

You can designate a standard channel to a specific topic, project, or department. Conversations and shared files in a standard channel are searchable within the channel and across the team.

> [!TIP]
> After creating a team, you'll notice a channel called **general**. The general channel is actually a standard channel.

## Uses for a standard channel

- **Project collaboration**: Standard channels can be used as a shared workspace for teams to work on projects together, share files, track progress and communicate in real-time.
- **Departmental communication**: Standard channels can be created for different departments such as within an organization.
- **Cross-functional teams**: Standard channels can be used by cross-functional teams to collaborate on initiatives that require input and participation from multiple departments.
- **Topic-based discussion**: Standard channels can be used to facilitate discussions on specific topics such as company news or product updates.
- **Knowledge management**: Standard channels can be used as a centralized repository for important information, such as company policies, procedures and best practices.
