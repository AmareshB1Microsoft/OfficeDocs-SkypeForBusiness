# Generating a one-time password (OTP)

One-time passwords (OTPs) are passwords that are valid for only one sign-in session or transaction. They're usually generated by IT administrators using the Pro Management portal. These OTPs are shared with site technicians who install the meeting rooms and deploy Teams Rooms devices. The site technician then enters the OTP on the Teams Rooms device and completes the setup without ever needing the username and password.

## How to generate a one-time password

To generate an OTP, perform the following steps:

1. Sign in to the Pro Management portal.
1. On the left navigation pane, select **Resource accounts**. The **Resource accounts** page appears.
1. Select the **Generate OTP** wizard on the command bar.
1. Select the resource accounts for which you want to generate an OTP.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can also search for specific resource accounts using the search bar.

   > [!NOTE]
   > For the resource accounts to which you want to assign an OTP, check how well that account has been set up by referring to the **Readiness Status** column. You can only select those resource accounts for OTP assignation that show a status **Ready** in the **Readiness Status** column. The status **Ready** implies that those accounts have been properly configured for Teams Rooms, and are ready to get an OTP assigned. If a resource account shows the status **Change settings** and **No valid license** in its **Readiness status** column, you can't select those resource accounts for OTP assignation. The **Change settings** and **No valid license** statuses imply that the account hasn't been set up correctly or doesn't have a valid license. You can't assign an OTP to such a resource account.

1. Select **Next**.

## Verify and approve OTP

You can verify and approve an OTP that was entered by the setup personnel while trying to sign in their Teams Rooms device into the app.

To verify and approve an OTP, perform the following steps:

1. Sign in to the Pro Management portal.
1. On the left navigation pane, select **Resource accounts**. The **Resource accounts** page appears.
1. Select a resource account which has the value **Awaiting OTP Approval**. The page displaying the details of the chosen resource account appears.
1. Verify the details such as:
   - who made the OTP, which is displayed in the **Requested by** column.
   - date when this OTP was entered on the device, which is displayed in the **Requested date** column.
   - expiration date, which is displayed in the **Expiration date** column.
   - device-related information such as make, model, and serial number, which is displayed in the **Device information** pane.
1. Select the **Approve the request** radio button, if you want to approve the OTP request.
1. Select the **Reject the request** radio button, if you want to reject the OTP request.
1. Select **Resolve OTP request**.
