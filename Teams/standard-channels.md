# Overview of standard channels in Microsoft Teams

A teams channel is a dedicated space within a team where members can engage in conversations, share files and collaborate on projects.

There are three types of channels in Microsoft Teams that serve different purposes: standard, [private](private-channels.md) and [shared](shared-channels.md).

In this article, we'll focus on standard channels, compare them to private and shared channels, and explore use case scenarios for using standard channels.

## What is a standard channel?

 In Microsoft Teams, a standard channel is visible and accessible to all team members. Standard channels provide spaces for members to collaborate and communicate within your organization. Like private and shared channels, you can designate a standard channel to a specific subject, project or department.

### What is a General channel?

By default, every team in Microsoft Teams has a "**General**" channel. General channels permanently appear at the top of the channel list of a team. The General channel can be used as a space for announcements or conversation that doesn't fall into your other subject-specific channels.

> [!TIP]
> Conversations and shared files in a standard channel are also searchable within the channel and across the team.

## How are SharePoint sites and Teams standard channels linked?

SharePoint sites let you create web pages and store files. When a SharePoint site is also used by Teams, it becomes a Teams-connected site.

 Standard channels share the same SharePoint site when you create a team. Each standard channel appears as a folder in the **Files** tab of a team. Items in the Files folder are the same All team owners and members can access the site.

## Features of standard, private and shared channels

|  Channel type | Visibility | Accessibility | Use cases |

| ***Standard***    | Team       | All members  | Group discussions, project updates, file sharing |
| ***Private***      | Restricted | Subset of team members | Sensitive information, restricted discussions |
| ***Shared***       | Cross-organizational | Both organizations | Cross-organizational projects, internal collaboration

## Standard channel owner and member actions

The following table outlines what actions owners, members, and guests can do in standard channels.

|***Standard channel tasks*** | **Team owner** | **Team member**|

Manage tabs and apps    |    Yes    |    Yes, if enabled by team owner    |

## Use case scenarios for standard channels

Standard channels are versatile and can be used in various scenarios to streamline team communication and collaboration. Here are some common use cases:

- **Project collaboration**: Create a standard channel for each project to facilitate communication, file sharing, and collaboration among team members. Standard channels can be used as a shared workspace for teammates to work on projects together, share files, track progress and communicate in real-time.
- **Departmental communication**: Designate a channel for your team to discuss specific subjects and share relevant resources.
- **Cross-functional teams**: Collaborate on initiatives that require input and participation from multiple departments with a standard channel.
- **Announcements and updates**: Utilize the "General" channel or create a dedicated standard channel for announcements, updates and news to keep everyone informed.
- **Knowledge sharing**: Establish a channel to share best practices, training materials and resources. A standard channel can also be a centralized knowledge base for procedural documentation and company policies such as role-specific procedures and best practices.
- **Social and networking**: Encourage team bonding and camaraderie by creating standard channels to encourage non-work related conversation subjects like hobbies, interests, or morale events.
