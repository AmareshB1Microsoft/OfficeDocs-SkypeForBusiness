# Overview of standard channels in Microsoft Teams

A teams channel is a dedicated space within a team where members can engage in conversations, share files and collaborate on projects.

There are three types of channels in Microsoft Teams that serve different purposes: standard, [private](private-channels.md) and [shared](shared-channels.md).

In this article, we'll focus on standard channels, compare them to private and shared channels, and explore use case scenarios for using standard channels.

## What is a standard channel?

By default, every team created in Microsoft Teams has a "**General**" channel. Standard channels are visible and accessible by all team members and designed to provide spaces for members to collaborate and communicate. Like private and shared channels, you can designate a standard channel to a specific article, project, or department.

> [!TIP]
> Conversations and shared files in a standard channel are also searchable within the channel and across the team.

## How are SharePoint sites and Teams standard channels linked?

SharePoint sites let you create web pages and store files. When a SharePoint site is also used by Teams, it becomes a Teams-connected site.

A Teams-connected site is created during the following scenarios:

- Create a new team from scratch
- Create a new team from an existing Microsoft 365 group
- Add Microsoft Teams to any existing SharePoint site
- Create a new private or shared channel

Standard channels will share one SharePoint site known as the parent site. Each standard channel is listed as a folder in the **Files** tab of a team. All team owners and members can access the site.

## Features of standard, private and shared channels

|  Channel type | Visibility | Accessibility | Use cases |
|--------------|------------|--------------|-----------|
| ***Standard***    | Team       | All members  | Group discussions, project updates, file sharing |
| ***Private***      | Restricted | Subset of team members | Sensitive information, restricted discussions |
| ***Shared***       | Cross-organizational | Both organizations | Cross-organizational projects, internal collaboration

## Standard channel owner and member actions

The following table outlines what actions owners, members, and guests can do in standard channels.

|***Standard channel tasks*** | **Team owner** | **Team member**|
|----|----|----|
|Create/Delete channel  |     Yes    |    Yes, if enabled by team owner      |
| Restore deleted channel    |    Yes    |    Yes, if enabled by team owner    |
|Add member to channel    |    Yes    |    Yes, if team owner approves request    |
|Edit channel name/description    |    Yes     |     Yes, if enabled by team owner    |
Manage tabs and apps    |    Yes    |    Yes, if enabled by team owner    |

## Use case scenarios for standard channels

Standard channels are versatile and can be used in various scenarios to streamline team communication and collaboration. Here are some common use cases:

- **Project collaboration**: Create a standard channel for each project to facilitate communication, file sharing, and collaboration among team members working on the project. Standard channels can be used as a shared workspace for teams to work on projects together, share files, track progress and communicate in real-time.
- **Departmental communication**: Organize channels by department, such as Marketing, Sales, or HR, to create a dedicated space for each team to discuss department-specific subjects and share relevant resources.
- **Cross-functional teams**: Collaborate on initiatives that require input and participation from multiple departments with a standard channel.
- **Announcements and updates**: Utilize the "General" channel or create a dedicated standard channel for company-wide announcements, updates, and news to keep everyone informed.
- **Knowledge sharing**: Establish a standard channel for sharing best practices, training materials, and resources to support continuous learning and professional development. A standard channel can also act as a centralized repository for important information, such as company policies, procedures and best practices.
- **Social and networking**: Encourage team bonding and camaraderie by creating standard channels for non-work-related articles, such as hobbies, interests, or company events.
