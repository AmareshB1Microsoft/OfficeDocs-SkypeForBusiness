# Attendance report for meetings and webinars in Microsoft Teams

As an admin, you control whether meeting organizers can download an attendance report (formerly known as an "engagement report") by settings in a Teams meeting policy. By default, the ability to download the report is on.

During the meeting, organizers can find the attendance report in the **People** > **Participants** pane of the meeting, in areas within the meeting invite, and in the meeting chat. After the meeting has ended, organizers can view and download the attendance report under the **Attendance** tab of the meeting invite or meeting chat. Read more about [how meeting organizers can view and download attendance reports in Teams](https://support.microsoft.com/office/ae7cf170-530c-47d3-84c1-3aedac74d310).

For education tenants, the attendance report can be used to track student attendance in online classes. For example, a teacher can download the attendance report at the start of class as a simple way to do a roll call.

## Set attendance report policies in Teams admin center

1. From the Teams admin center, go to **Meetings** > **Meeting policies** and choose the policy you want to update. To create a new policy, click **Add**.
1. Under **Meeting scheduling**, choose one of the following for **Attendance report**:
    - **Everyone, unless organizers opt-out** - Meeting organizers to can turn on or off attendance reports for a meeting. This setting is on by default.
    - **No one** - Meeting organizers can't view or download attendance reports for a webinar or meeting they have organized.
    - **Everyone** - Meeting organizers can't turn off attendance reports for a webinar or meeting.
1. For **Who is in the report**, choose one of the following:
    - **Everyone, but users can opt-out** - The attendance report will initially include all users, but users can opt-out. This setting is on by default.
    - **No one, but users can opt-in** - The attendance report will initially exclude all users, but users can opt-in.
    - **Everyone** - The attendance report will include all users, and users can't opt-out.
    - **No one** - The attendance report will exclude all users, and users can't opt-in.
1. For **Attendance summary**, choose one of the following:
    - **Show everything** - Include meeting attendees' join times, leave times, and in-meeting duration. This setting is on by default.
    - **Only show who attended** - Doesn't include meeting attendees' join times, leave times, and in-meeting duration.
1. Once you have made your policy setting selections, hit **Save** at the bottom of the page.

> [!NOTE]
> As an administrator, you can’t view the attendance report for meetings that you don’t organize. However, you can view participant details for a given meeting within 24 hours of that meeting. In the Teams admin center, go to **Users** > **Manage users**. Choose the display name for the meeting organizer. Select the **Meetings & calls** tab, and then choose the appropriate meeting ID or call ID. Then, select **Participant details**.

## Set attendance report policies with PowerShell

In PowerShell, you can use the `-AllowEngagementReport` parameter and [Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy cmdlet](/powershell/module/skype/set-csteamsmeetingpolicy) to turn on attendance reports. This policy is on by default.

To turn off attendance reports, run the following script:

```powershell
Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity <policy name> -AllowEngagementReport Disabled
```

To turn on attendance reports that will initially exclude all users but that will give users the ability to opt-in, run the following script:

```powershell
Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity <policy name> -AllowEngagementReport ForceEnabled
Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity <policy name> -AllowTrackingInReport DisabledUserOverride
```

To give meeting organizers the option to turn on or turn off attendance reports that only show who attended, run the following script:

```powershell
Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity <policy name> -AllowEngagementReport Enabled
Set-CsTeamsMeetingPolicy -Identity <policy name> -InfoShownInReportMode identityOnly
```
